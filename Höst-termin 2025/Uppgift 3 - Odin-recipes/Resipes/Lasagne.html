    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        This classic lasagna recipe is made with an easy meat sauce as the base. 
        Layer the sauce with noodles and cheese, then bake until bubbly! This is 
        great for feeding a big family and freezes well, too.
    </p>

        </li>
        <li>
            125g ball mozzarella (torn into thin strips)
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            To make the meat sauce, heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a frying pan and cook 750g 
            lean beef mince in two batches for about 10 mins until browned all over.
        </li>
        <li>
            Finely chop 4 slices of prosciutto from a 90g pack, then stir through the meat mixture.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour over 800g passata or half our basic tomato sauce recipe and 200ml hot beef stock. 
            Add a little grated nutmeg, then season.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bring up to the boil, then simmer for 30 mins until the sauce looks rich.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and lightly oil an ovenproof dish (about 30 x 20cm).
        </li>
        <li>
            Spoon one third of the meat sauce into the dish, then cover with some fresh lasagne 
            sheets from a 300g pack. Drizzle over roughly 130g ready-made or homemade white sauce.
        </li>
        <li>
            Repeat until you have three layers of pasta. Cover with the remaining 390g white sauce, 
            making sure you can’t see any pasta poking through.
        </li>
        <li>
            Scatter 125g torn mozzarella over the top.
        </li>
        <li>
            Arrange the rest of the prosciutto on top. Bake for 45 mins until the top is bubbling and lightly browned.
        </li>
    </ol>
